# A quick comprehension test of f-strings with some CRRRAZZZZYYYYY results


#ask user to input 2 nouns and two 2 adjectives to make the madlib an incomprehensible mess
noun1 = input("Noun: ")
noun2 = input("Noun: ")
adj1 = input ("adjective: ")
adj2 = input ("adjective: ")


#the string that the nouns and adjectives are added to as per their 'placeholders'

madlib = f"I used the {noun1} to clean the toilet after my {adj1} {noun2}. Safe to\
 say, the inlaws were {adj2}."

#finally, we print the madlib with added inputs, to much hilarity
print(madlib)
